# Signals

This module extends [Signalization](./Signalization.md) to define how to generate `Signal`.

## Dependencies

This module depends on [Signalization](./Signalization.md).

## Architecture

| Word | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Emission | Token to send `Signal`. |
| Transmission | Collects `Consumption` to send `Signal`. |
| Generation | Creates `Signal`. |
| Ignition | `Connection` to emit. |

`Emission` is token to send `Signal`.
`Generation` is how to generate `Signal` to convert `Transmission` that is `Emission` and `Production`.
Every time `Transmission` Emits,  it sends `Signal` generated by `Generation` to each of `Consumption`.

`Ignition` is `Emission` and `Connection`.

## Implementation

Nothing except internal implementations for [Signalization](./Signalization.md).
